# arkanoPi
Project based on the implementation of a specific design on a stand-alone or embedded system based on a microprocessor, in our case we do it in the Raspberry-Pi. This design is really the realization of an initial version of the two legendary video games 'Arkanoid' and 'Pong'.
Some of the features of the system are:
* different levels of difficulty
* pause/resume the game, incorporation of a Joystick
* random package that provides help to the user to make the game easier
* sound when hitting a racket, wall or brick.
